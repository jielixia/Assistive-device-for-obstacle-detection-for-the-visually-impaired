# Assistive-device-for-obstacle-detection-for-the-visually-impaired
Prototype of a device meant for blind people to help them detect the obstacles around 3-4 meters. The principle is to convert depth image (captured by an RGB-D camera) into an audio information.
The depth image is captured in black and white, the brighter the color of the picture is, the closer the object is. the information is given by a sound send to earphone. If the object is more to the left the sound will be more intense on the left than on the right.
